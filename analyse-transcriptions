I WANT YOU TO DO THESE TASKS (DO NOT SHOW ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING):

    Improve the text in @transcriptions.txt

    Classify the notes in @transcriptions.txt based on these groups: 
    - BDSR, 
    - MyWorkManagement.
    - STU
    - WTU
    PAY ATTENTION THAT COULD BE MORE SEPARATE SECTIONS IN @transcriptions.txt FOR THE SAME GROUP
    LEAVE @transcriptions.txt AS IT IS.

    After the classification:
    CREATE A NEW FILE for each group and copy the relative sections in them.
    The file name has to have this pattern group_YYYYMMDD 
    and have to be create in the folder KeepNotes/groups
