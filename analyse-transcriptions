I WANT YOU TO DO THESE TASKS (DO NOT SHOW ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING):

1. Analyze the @transcriptions.txt file and identify all sections that start with "I'm working on"

2. Classify these sections into the following groups:
   - BDSR
   - MyWorkManagement
   - STU
   - WTU
   - Proceding

3. For each group, create a separate file in the groups/ folder with the naming pattern: group_YYYYMMDD.txt (YYYYMMDD means the actual current date)

4. Copy the relevant sections (including all content between "I'm working on" sections) into the appropriate group files

5. Leave the original transcriptions.txt file unchanged

6. Show me the classification results and confirm when the files are created

PAY ATTENTION: Focus on the "I'm working on" sections as the main classification criteria. Each section that starts with "I'm working on" should be classified into one of the specified groups based on the content and context.
